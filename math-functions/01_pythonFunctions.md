# Python Functions

Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. They can take inputs, perform operations, and return results. Here's an example:

```python  
def greet(name):  
   return "Hello " + name + "!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!  
```

We are already familiar with some built-in Python functions like `print()`, `range()`, and `input()`
