# Python vs. Python 3

In this class, we use the lastest version of Python, which is **Python 3**. 

On some systems, `python main.py` will run `main.py` using Python 3. On others, you need to type `python3 main.py` in order for your code to run correctly.

For now, try both. Whichever one works for you is likely the one you will stick with for the rest of the term.
