# Laptops

This course requires a laptop with the specifications linked in the syllabus. 

If your laptop isn't ideal for coding, you can request a loaner laptop using the form linked in the syllabus. Sometimes it's a good idea to borrow a department laptop so your code isn't competing for RAM with your games etc.
