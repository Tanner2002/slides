# Course Expectations

- Get excited that it's hard! More effort = more reward
- (Expect and embrace frustration)
- Standard college course expectation: 5-10 hours of work outside class time
- If something doesn't come together in lecture, use resources provided in syllabus to help you understand. Take the time to figure out how you learn best. 
- Read each word of written instructions
