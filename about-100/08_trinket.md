# Trinket

![Alt text](image-5.png)

Trinket is a browser-based coding platform that we will use in the first half of the semester so that we can code right away without having to install anything.

We will be using two kinds of Trinket in this class: Python and VPython. VPython trinkets have the VPython module already imported. Python trinkets only include the base python language.
