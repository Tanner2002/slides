# Where to Find Content

You can find all the GitHub and Discord links you need on the Canvas homepage, but you'll turn in assignments on GitHub, not Canvas.

This course uses GitHub Classroom instead of Canvas for assignment submission. This is because GitHub classroom is specialized for coding instruction, and Canvas is not.

Course updates will be posted in Discord.
