# trinket.io

**trinket.io** is a platform that allows you to code right in the browser without having to install anything on your computer. This is a very convenient way to begin coding!

We will be using two kinds of trinkets in class: **Python** and **VPython**. Python trinkets include pure Python without the addition of the VPython library. VPython trinkets include both Python and VPython and allow you to code and render 3D images in tbe browser.
