# Where to find Materials & Assignments

## This course is run out of **GitHub** instead of **Canvas**. 

You will turn in assignments simply by updating your assignment repositiories on GitHub. We don't use Canvas because GitHub is built for code review and allows for faster grading and better feedback. 

## Important links are on Canvas homepage, but assignments aren't processed in Canvas. 

Except for the first one, you won't find your assignments in the normal Canvas assignment interface. However, all your most important resources on GitHub are linked in your canvas homepage. You may need to be logged into GitHub or Google to access some materials.
