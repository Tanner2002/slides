GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting code.  It is an industry standard tool and knowing it unlocks countless doors. 

A Git repository (or repo) is essentially a folder for code, where you can collaborate manage version history. It will often also include instructions.  

Each assignment in this class links to a different GitHub repo.
