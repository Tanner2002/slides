# While Loops Review

```
i = 1
while i < 4:
    print(i * 'X')
    i = i + 1
```

Here's a breakdown of what the above code does

| i | output |   
| - | ------ | 
| 1 | X      |   
| 2 | XX     |   
| 3 | XXX   |   

There is no fourth row because afer the third loop, the loop's condition is no longer true.
