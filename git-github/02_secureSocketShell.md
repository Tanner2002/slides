SSH is cryptographic system that allows you to secure digital assets with strong ciphers. In Github, SSH allows you to access your work on Github from the command line safely.

To access your private Git repos locally, you install an SSH key on your computer. This key unlocks your assets so you can easily sync your local repos to Github.
