# Git and Github

![alt text](image.png)

Git and Github are often used together, but they are different. Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your files.

GitHub is an online platform that uses Git to host repos collaboratively. Developers use Git to manage code versions locally, and GitHub for sharing, collaborating, and managing repos online. This allows for teamwork, open-source coding, and sharing code with your classmates and professor!
