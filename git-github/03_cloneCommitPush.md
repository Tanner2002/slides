# Clone, Commit, Push

Clone, add, commit, and push are three very important `git` commands! See syntax beneath each concept.
- *Cloning* means making a local copy of a repo from GitHub. 
  - **`git clone <repo-link>`**
- *Adding* files allows them to be part of the next commit.
  - **`git add .`**
  - ⬆️ note the dot, which adds all files in the current directory to the next commit!
- *Commits* are versions of your code that have been saved with a message, so you can retrace your steps.
  - **`git commit -m <commit-message>`**
- *pushing* means sending your local changes to the remote version of your code on GitHub.
  - **`git push`**
