# Clone, Commit, Push

Clone, commit, and push are three very important `git` commands! 
- *Cloning* means making a local copy of a repo from github. Syntax: `git clone <repo-link>`
- *adding* files allows them to be part of the next commit. Syntax: `git add .` <- note the dot, which adds all files in the current directory to the next commit!
- *Commits* are versions of your code that have been saved with a message, so you can retrace your steps. Syntax: `git commit -m <commit-message>`
- *pushing* means sending your local changes to the remote version of your code on GitHub. Syntax: `git push`
