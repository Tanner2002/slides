# Comparison Operators

In programming, comparison operators are used to compare values and return a boolean result. Common operators include:

- `==` (equal to)
- `!=` (not equal to)
- `<` (less than)
- `>` (greater than)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)

These operators are fundamental for creating boolean expressions, which evaluate to either `True` or `False`.
