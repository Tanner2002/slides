# Basic Commands for File Management

Many command lines take arguments, just like functions in Python. Positiional arguments are listed directly after the command. 

```terminal
$ mkdir red # makes directory red
$ cd red # chooses directory red
$ echo one>1.txt # writes 'one' to file 1.txt
$ cd .. # chooses parent directory (the path holding path red)

```

> [!NOTE]
> When Terminal commands are formatted as above in code examples, the `$` indicates a new line and should not be typed.
