# Built-In Python Functions

We will learn more about functions later on in the semester, but for now you just need to know a little bit about what a function is and how to call it.

A function is a block of code that has been packaged under a single name for convenient access. You can deploy that block of code simply by **calling** the function's name.

Functions we've used in class so far include `print()` which prints text to the console and `str()`, which converts values to the string datatype.
