# Function Calling Syntax

A function call will always consist of the name of the function, followed by open and close parens `()`.

Many functions receive inputs, known as **arguments.** When you are feeding a function arguments, you put them **between** the open and close parens: `(<arguments>)`.

For example, the print function requires some text for it to print. So to print hello world, you would type:

```
print("Hello world!")
```
