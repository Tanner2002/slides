## Introduction to If Statements in Python

In Python, `if` statements are used for conditional execution. They allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions.

```python
# Example of an if statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```
This example will print "x is greater than 5" because the condition `x > 5` evaluates to `True`.
