## If-Else Statements in Python

In Python, `if-else` statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

```python
# Example of an if-else statement
x = 3
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```

In this example, since `x` is not greater than 5, the code block under the `else` statement will be executed, printing "x is not greater than 5".
