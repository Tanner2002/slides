# List Indices

To get an item in a list you call its **index**, by naming the list and then putting the index between square brackets.

The index of the first item in a list is always 0. The last item is the length of the list less one.

```
# color names stored as a list of strings called colors

colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]

colors[0] # red
colors[1] # orange
colors[2] # yellow
colors[3] # green
colors[4] # blue
colors[5] # purple

```
