# For Loop

A `for-loop` is another type of loop in python, which runs one time for each item in a list. The code below outputs 0-9 to the console.

```
for i in range(10):
	print(i)
```

The syntax above are as follows:

```
for <var> in <list>:
	# do something with <var>
```

Where `<var>` is the name of the variable that will contain the value of current element in the list, and `<list>` is the name of the list you are iterating through.Â   
Note that in examples like this, when you swap in your code you get rid of the angle brackets `<>.`
