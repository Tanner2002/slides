# Lists

Lists in Python are ordered collections of items. They are mutable, versatile, and can contain elements of different types.

Lists are written between square brackets `[]`, with elements separated by commas:

```
# color names stored as a list of strings called colors

colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]

# even numbers stored as a lit of integers called even_numbers

even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
