# Understanding Keys and Values in Python Dictionaries

In Python dictionaries, keys and values play crucial roles in organizing and accessing data efficiently.

## Keys

Keys are the immutable (meaning stable and unchanging) names for values within a Python dictionary. 

**Keys must be unique** within a dictionary; duplicate keys are not allowed.

## Values

Dictionary values are... 

- **flexible**: They can be of any data type, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, or even custom objects.
- **mutable**: Unlike keys, values can be mutable or immutable. This allows for storing and accessing dynamic data structures within a dictionary.
- **accessed with keys**: Values are accessed using their corresponding keys, providing a fast and efficient way to retrieve information from a dictionary.
