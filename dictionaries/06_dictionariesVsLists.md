# Dictionaries vs Lists

Why would you use a dictionary instead of a list or vice versa? 

A list is great for values that are best accessed by index or iterated through in a loop. Often, a list is the best choice of datatype when the order of the values matters, but the values will be used in the same way.

A dictionary is most useful when values need to be looked up efficiently by name. This makes sense when different values are being used in different ways in a consistent structure.
