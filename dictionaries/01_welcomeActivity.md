# Dictionaries | Welcome Activity

Use [this link](https://trinket.io/python/22232e8cdf) to respond to ANY of the following prompts (you don't need to do all of them). You can answer questions in the Discord thread or verbally in class. 

As you try things out, feel free to post your remixed trinkets in the Discord thread. 

- What happens when you change the numbers on line 9?
- What happens when you change `"Sally"` to a different name? 
- The value of `myCar`is a dictionary data type. Can you guess what the `{}`, `:`, and `,` do when you declare a dictionary? 
- How can you remove the name text from the animation?

## Seeds for future learning

The starter code includes `import` (lines 5-6) and some new string manipulations (line 17, 21). We will cover these topics in more detail in later classes.
