# Lab Resubmission

You can resubmit individual labs (except the final project) for two weeks after receiving your grade.
The Pastiche Animation resubmission deadline is May 5. 

**You can find your initial lab grade in your gradebook [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/7dLK4j3-).**

**To resubmit a lab, update it in the original assignment repo and then e-mail the professor before the resubmit deadline.**
