# Thank you for filling out the course feedback survey! 
## Here are a few thoughts based on your answers:

- I have seen progress in Python skills for every single one of you. Remember to compare your progress to yourself at the start of the semester, and not to your classmates who may have come in with a different level of experience.
- If you ever feel lost, please book an office hours appointment! The link is on this course's
canvas home page. This is the best way I can calibrate my teaching for your individual learning (instead of for twenty different people). 
- I will also work on adjusting the pace of demos
- It is unlikely that I can find an efficient way to post assignments for this class in Canvas, but I will look into it.
