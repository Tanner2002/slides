# Lab Shares

- Everyone is required to share one lab each semester.
- When you share you should include the following info: 
  - Your creative goals for the assignment
  - Explain the section of code you found the most challenging
  - Talk about something new you learned from the lab
  - Explain what you are most proud of in the assignment
- If you would like to share your most recent lab, put a link to your Trinket in the class Discord channel.
