# Next Coding Quiz on February 23!

- This quiz will be closed book, on paper. It willl cover lecture content from Week 4 - Week 5, and include short answer and multiple choice questions.
- The best materials to study are:
  - [Problem Set 3](https://classroom.github.com/a/YirqgstC)
  - [Lecture Materials](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-spring-2024/slides/blob/main/README.md#lists-and-for-loops-continued-213) from Feb 8 - 13
- Note that the quiz after this one will be cumulative! But the 2/23 quiz covers only Week 4 - 5. 

## A Quick Reminder

- Lab meets every Friday unless I specify otherwise!
- Lab now meets in room 207 at 2:45 pm. I encourage you to enjoy iTea downstairs before class starts!
