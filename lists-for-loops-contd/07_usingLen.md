# Using the len() function to get list position

![Alt text](image-2.png)

If you want to iterate through a list AND use the current position of the list, the `len()` function can help you do it. 

[This example](https://trinket.io/glowscript/45b1bfbf80) modifies an earlier, getting the index of the current earth  to determine the angle of rotation. This means each earth rotates at a different speed.
