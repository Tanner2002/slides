## You can name variables *almost** anything you want!*

It's a good idea to give your variables names that are a happy medium of descriptive and easy to type.

### These two code blocks are the same in effect

```
clr = "blue"
sphere(color = clr)
```

```
c = "blue"
sphere(color = c)
```
* You can't start variable names with numbers in Python, and also shouldn't give variables names that already have some function (like int, or in VPython, sphere)
