# Introduction to Classes and Methods in Python

Classes in Python allow you to define your own data types and organize related functionality into methods. Methods are functions defined within classes that operate on instances of the class. They provide a powerful way to structure and reuse code.

**Example:** 
Imagine you're building a game. You can create a `Player` class with methods like `move()` and `attack()`. Each player object can have its own properties like health and position, managed by these methods.
