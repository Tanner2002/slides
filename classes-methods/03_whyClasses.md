# Why Classes?

Classes offer several advantages over regular functions:

1. **Encapsulation:** Classes encapsulate data and behavior into a single unit, promoting clean and organized code.

2. **Code Reusability:** With classes, you can reuse code by creating multiple instances with the same structure and behavior.

3. **Inheritance:** Classes support inheritance, allowing you to create new classes based on existing ones, saving time and effort.

4. **Modularity:** Classes facilitate modular programming, making it easier to maintain and extend your codebase.
